          Before the global financial crisis of 2008, Barbados' economy was
          growing steadily.  Afterwards, not so much.  But how much of their GDP
          have they been spending on food?

          Over the past 30 years, despite their GDP increasing, they have been spending
          roughly the same fraction of their GDP on food.  How does this compare with other
          islands in the Caribbean and around the world?

          The Caribbean islands are all varied in how much of their GDP they spend
          on food imports.  Like the smaller islands Barbados spends a larger share
          on food but this translates to being the second highest spent per person.
          Is all of this spending avoidable? Can Barbados produce enough food to
          to meet the demands of its population?

        Barbados devotes over a quarter of its land to crops yet this translates
        to less that 15 hectares.  Importing food is a necessary evil for
        Barbados as it doesn't have to space to grow its own food.
